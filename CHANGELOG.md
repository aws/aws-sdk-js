You can now copy the source files from a MySQL database to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket, and then restore an Amazon Aurora DB cluster from those files. This option can be considerably faster than migrating data using mysqldump.

* bugfix: Request: Adds a content-length check for the stream returned from `createReadStream()`, and the stream will emit an error when the bytes received are fewer than specified by the response content-length header.
