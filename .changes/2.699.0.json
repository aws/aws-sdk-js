        "description": "AWS Snowcone is a portable, rugged and secure device for edge computing and data transfer. You can use Snowcone to collect, process, and move data to AWS, either offline by shipping the device to AWS or online by using AWS DataSync. With 2 CPUs and 4 GB RAM of compute and 8 TB of storage, Snowcone can run edge computing workloads and store data securely. Snowcone's small size (8.94\" x 5.85\" x 3.25\" / 227 mm x 148.6 mm x 82.65 mm) allows you to set it next to machinery in a factory. Snowcone weighs about 4.5 lbs. (2 kg), so you can carry one in a backpack, use it with battery-based operation, and use the Wi-Fi interface to gather sensor data. Snowcone supports a file interface with NFS support. "
