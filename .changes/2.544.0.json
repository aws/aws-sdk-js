Previously, updating your Snowball Edge's software required that the device be connected to the internet or be sent back to AWS. Now, you can keep your Snowball Edge software up to date even if your device(s) cannot connect to the internet, or are required to run in an air-gapped environment. To complete offline updates, download the software update from a client machine with connection to the internet using the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI). Then, have the Snowball Edge device download and install the software update using the Snowball Edge device API. For more information about offline updates, visit the Snowball Edge documentation page."
