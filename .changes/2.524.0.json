Manual control over resource execution rate is also included, and RemediationConfigurations are now ARN addressable. Exceptions to exclude account resources from being remediated can be configured with the new PutRemediationExceptions, DescribeRemediationExceptions, and DeleteRemediationExceptions APIs."
