AWS Snowball Edge is a 100-TB ruggedized device built to transfer data into and out of AWS with optional support for local Lambda-based compute functions. With this feature, developers and administrators can run their EC2-based applications on the device providing them with an end to end vertically integrated AWS experience. Designed for data pre-processing, compression, machine learning, and data collection applications, these new instances, called SBE1 instances, feature 1.8 GHz Intel Xeon D processors up to 16 vCPUs, and 32 GB of memory. The SBE1 instance type is available in four sizes and multiple instances can be run on the device at the same time. Customers can now run compute instances using the same Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) that are used in Amazon EC2."
