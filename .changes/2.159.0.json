        "description": "Amazon DynamoDB now supports the following features: Global Table and On-Demand Backup. Global Table is a fully-managed, multi-region, multi-master database. DynamoDB customers can now write anywhere and read anywhere with single-digit millisecond latency by performing database operations closest to where end users reside. Global Table also enables customers to disaster-proof their applications, keeping them running and data accessible even in the face of natural disasters or region disruptions. Customers can set up Global Table with just a few clicks in the AWS Management Console-no application rewrites required. On-Demand Backup capability is to protect data from loss due to application errors, and meet customers' archival needs for compliance and regulatory reasons. Customers can backup and restore their DynamoDB table data anytime, with a single-click in the AWS management console or a single API call. Backup and restore actions execute with zero impact on table performance or availability. For more information, see the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide."
