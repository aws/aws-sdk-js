        "description": "You are now able to use instance storage (up to 1800 GB of NVMe based SSD) on C5 instances, the next generation of EC2's compute optimized instances in us-east-1, us-west-2, us-east-2, eu-west-1 and ca-central-1. C5 instances offer up to 72 vCPUs, 144 GiB of DDR4 instance memory, 25 Gbps in Network bandwidth and improved EBS and Networking bandwidth on smaller instance sizes to deliver improved performance for compute-intensive workloads.You can now run bare metal workloads on EC2 with i3.metal instances. As a new instance size belonging to the I3 instance family, i3.metal instances have the same characteristics as other instances in the family, including NVMe SSD-backed instance storage optimized for low latency, very high random I/O performance, and high sequential read throughput. I3.metal instances are powered by 2.3 GHz Intel Xeon processors, offering 36 hyper-threaded cores (72 logical processors), 512 GiB of memory, and 15.2 TB of NVMe SSD-backed instance storage. These instances deliver high networking throughput and lower latency with up to 25 Gbps of aggregate network bandwidth using Elastic Network Adapter (ENA)-based Enhanced Networking."
