        "description": "Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager adds support for copying EBS volume tags to EBS snapshots. AWS resource tags allow customers to add metadata and apply access policies to your Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) resources. Starting today, customers can use Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager (DLM) to copy tags on EBS volumes to EBS snapshots. This allows customers to easily set snapshot metadata, such as access policies, to match the parent volume. Customers can enable this functionality on new or existing lifecycle policies. They can also choose to disable it at a future date.  "
