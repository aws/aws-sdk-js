        "description": "Security Hub has now made it easier to opt out of default standards when you enable Security Hub. We added a new Boolean parameter to EnableSecurityHub called EnableDefaultStandards. If that parameter is true, Security Hub's default standards are enabled. A new Boolean parameter for standards, EnabledByDefault, indicates whether a standard is a default standard. Today, the only default standard is CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark v1.2. Additional default standards will be added in the future.To learn more, visit our documentation on the EnableSecurityHub API action."
