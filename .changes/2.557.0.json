Amazon S3 bucket names and paths can now be hidden from AWS SFTP users, providing an additional level of privacy to meet security requirements. You can lock down your SFTP users' access to designated folders (commonly referred to as 'chroot'), and simplify complex folder structures for data distribution through SFTP without replicating files across multiple users."
