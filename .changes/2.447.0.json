        "description": "AWS X-Ray now includes Analytics, an interactive approach to analyzing user request paths (i.e., traces). Analytics will allow you to easily understand how your application and its underlying services are performing. With X-Ray Analytics, you can quickly detect application issues, pinpoint the root cause of the issue, determine the severity of the issues, and identify which end users were impacted. With AWS X-Ray Analytics you can explore, analyze, and visualize traces, allowing you to find increases in response time to user requests or increases in error rates. Metadata around peak periods, including frequency and actual times of occurrence, can be investigated by applying filters with a few clicks. You can then drill down on specific errors, faults, and response time root causes and view the associated traces. "
