The Amazon EKS TagResource API allows customers to associate tags with their cluster. Customers can list tags for a cluster using the ListTagsForResource API and remove tags from a cluster with the UntagResource API. Note: tags are specific to the EKS cluster resource, they do not propagate to other AWS resources used by the cluster."
