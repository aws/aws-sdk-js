        "description": "With Origin Failover capability in CloudFront, you can setup two origins for your distributions - primary and secondary, such that your content is served from your secondary origin if CloudFront detects that your primary origin is unavailable. These origins can be any combination of AWS origins or non-AWS custom HTTP origins. For example, you can have two Amazon S3 buckets that serve as your origin that you independently upload your content to. If an object that CloudFront requests from your primary bucket is not present or if connection to your primary bucket times-out, CloudFront will request the object from your secondary bucket. So, you can configure CloudFront to trigger a failover in response to either HTTP 4xx or 5xx status codes."
