Ability to group on-premises servers into applications and application tiers. 2. Auto-generated CloudFormation Template and Stacks for launching migrated servers into EC2. 3. Ability to run post-launch configuration scripts to configure servers and applications in EC2. In order for SMS to launch servers into your AWS account using CloudFormation Templates, we have also updated the ServerMigrationServiceRole IAM policy to include appropriate permissions. Refer to Server Migration Service documentation for more details. "
