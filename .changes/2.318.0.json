By using S3 object tags, customers can identify individual objects for replication across AWS Regions for compliance and data protection. Cross Region Replication for S3 enables automatic and asynchronous replication of objects to another AWS Region, and with this release customers can replicate at a bucket level, prefix level or by using object tags."
