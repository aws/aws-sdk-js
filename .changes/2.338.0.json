        "description": "This release allows you to now turn on Quality-Defined Variable Bitrate (QVBR) encoding for your AWS Elemental MediaLive channels. You can now deliver a consistently high-quality video viewing experience while reducing overall distribution bitrates by using Quality-Defined Variable Bitrate (QVBR) encoding with AWS Elemental MediaLive. QVBR is a video compression technique that automatically adjusts output bitrates to the complexity of source content and only use the bits required to maintain a defined level of quality. This means using QVBR encoding, you can save on distribution cost, while maintaining, or increasing video quality for your viewers."
