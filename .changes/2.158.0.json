You are now able to save launch parameters in a single template that can be used with Auto Scaling, Spot Fleet, Spot, and On Demand instances. 3. You are now able to launch Spot instances via the RunInstances API, using a single additional parameter. RunInstances will response synchronously with an instance ID should capacity be available for your Spot request. 4. A simplified Spot pricing model which delivers low, predictable prices that adjust gradually, based on long-term trends in supply and demand. 5. Amazon EC2 Spot can now hibernate Amazon EBS-backed instances in the event of an interruption, so your workloads pick up from where they left off. Spot can fulfill your request by resuming instances from a hibernated state when capacity is available."
