 * This provider is checked by default in the Node.js environment. To use
 * the provider simply add your OIDC token to a file (ASCII encoding) and
 * share the filename in either AWS_WEB_IDENTITY_TOKEN_FILE environment
 * variable or web_identity_token_file shared config variable

 * environment variable or web_identity_token_file shared config variable,
 * and get the OIDC token from filename.
 * It will also read IAM role to be assumed from AWS_IAM_ROLE_ARN
 * environment variable or role_arn shared config variable.
