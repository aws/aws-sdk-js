The size of the subnet's IPv4 CIDR block can be the same as a VPC's IPv4 CIDR block, or a subset of a VPC's IPv4 CIDR block. If you create more than one subnet in a VPC, the subnets' CIDR blocks must not overlap. The smallest IPv4 subnet (and VPC) you can create uses a /28 netmask (16 IPv4 addresses), and the largest uses a /16 netmask (65,536 IPv4 addresses). If you've associated an IPv6 CIDR block with your VPC, you can create a subnet with an IPv6 CIDR block that uses a /64 prefix length.   AWS reserves both the first four and the last IPv4 address in each subnet's CIDR block. They're not available for use.  If you add more than one subnet to a VPC, they're set up in a star topology with a logical router in the middle. If you launch an instance in a VPC using an Amazon EBS-backed AMI, the IP address doesn't change if you stop and restart the instance (unlike a similar instance launched outside a VPC, which gets a new IP address when restarted). It's therefore possible to have a subnet with no running instances (they're all stopped), but no remaining IP addresses available. For more information about subnets, see Your VPC and Subnets in the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide.

The performance of a volume can be affected if an issue occurs on the volume's underlying host. If the volume's underlying host experiences a power outage or system issue, after the system is restored, there could be data inconsistencies on the volume. Volume events notify you if this occurs. Volume actions notify you if any action needs to be taken in response to the event. The DescribeVolumeStatus operation provides the following information about the specified volumes:  Status: Reflects the current status of the volume. The possible values are ok, impaired , warning, or insufficient-data. If all checks pass, the overall status of the volume is ok. If the check fails, the overall status is impaired. If the status is insufficient-data, then the checks may still be taking place on your volume at the time. We recommend that you retry the request.

This means that your volume has been affected by an issue with the underlying host, has all I/O operations disabled, and may have inconsistent data.  Actions: Reflect the actions you may have to take in response to an event. For example, if the status of the volume is impaired and the volume event shows potential-data-inconsistency, then the action shows enable-volume-io. This means that you may want to enable the I/O operations for the volume by calling the EnableVolumeIO action and then check the volume for data consistency. Volume status is based on the volume status checks, and does not reflect the volume state.

You can use CloudWatch Events to check the status of a modification to an EBS volume. For information about CloudWatch Events, see the Amazon CloudWatch Events User Guide. You can also track the status of a modification using DescribeVolumesModifications. For information about tracking status changes using either method, see Monitoring Volume Modifications.  With previous-generation instance types, resizing an EBS volume may require detaching and reattaching the volume or stopping and restarting the instance. For more information, see Modifying the Size, IOPS, or Type of an EBS Volume on Linux and Modifying the Size, IOPS, or Type of an EBS Volume on Windows. If you reach the maximum volume modification rate per volume limit, you will need to wait at least six hours before applying further modifications to the affected EBS volume.

  /**
   * Stops an Amazon EBS-backed instance. You can use the Stop action to hibernate an instance if the instance is enabled for hibernation and it meets the hibernation prerequisites. For more information, see Hibernate Your Instance in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide. We don't charge usage for a stopped instance, or data transfer fees; however, your root partition Amazon EBS volume remains and continues to persist your data, and you are charged for Amazon EBS volume usage. Every time you start your Windows instance, Amazon EC2 charges you for a full instance hour. If you stop and restart your Windows instance, a new instance hour begins and Amazon EC2 charges you for another full instance hour even if you are still within the same 60-minute period when it was stopped. Every time you start your Linux instance, Amazon EC2 charges a one-minute minimum for instance usage, and thereafter charges per second for instance usage. You can't start, stop, or hibernate Spot Instances, and you can't stop or hibernate instance store-backed instances. For information about using hibernation for Spot Instances, see Hibernating Interrupted Spot Instances in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide. When you stop or hibernate an instance, we shut it down. You can restart your instance at any time. Before stopping or hibernating an instance, make sure it is in a state from which it can be restarted. Stopping an instance does not preserve data stored in RAM, but hibernating an instance does preserve data stored in RAM. If an instance cannot hibernate successfully, a normal shutdown occurs. Stopping and hibernating an instance is different to rebooting or terminating it. For example, when you stop or hibernate an instance, the root device and any other devices attached to the instance persist. When you terminate an instance, the root device and any other devices attached during the instance launch are automatically deleted. For more information about the differences between rebooting, stopping, hibernating, and terminating instances, see Instance Lifecycle in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide. When you stop an instance, we attempt to shut it down forcibly after a short while. If your instance appears stuck in the stopping state after a period of time, there may be an issue with the underlying host computer. For more information, see Troubleshooting Stopping Your Instance in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide.
