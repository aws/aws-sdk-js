  "documentation":"<fullname>Amazon GameLift Service</fullname> <p>Welcome to the <i>Amazon GameLift API Reference</i>. Amazon GameLift is a managed Amazon Web Services (AWS) service for developers who need a scalable, server-based solution for multiplayer games. Amazon GameLift provides setup and deployment of game servers, and handles infrastructure scaling and session management.</p> <p>This reference describes the low-level service API for GameLift. You can call this API directly or use the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/tools/#sdk\">AWS SDK</a> for your preferred language. The AWS SDK includes a set of high-level GameLift actions multiplayer game sessions. Alternatively, you can use the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cli/\">AWS command-line interface</a> (CLI) tool, which includes commands for GameLift. For administrative actions, you can also use the Amazon GameLift console. </p> <p><b>More Resources</b></p> <ul> <li> <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/\">Amazon GameLift Developer Guide</a>: Learn more about GameLift features and how to use them </li> <li> <a href=\"https://gamedev.amazon.com/forums/tutorials\">Lumberyard and GameLift Tutorials</a>: Get started fast with walkthroughs and sample projects</li> <li> <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/gamedev/\">GameDev Blog</a>: Stay up to date with new features and techniques</li> <li> <a href=\"https://gamedev.amazon.com/forums/spaces/123/gamelift-discussion.html\">GameDev Forums</a>: Connect with the GameDev community</li> </ul> <p><b>Manage Games and Players Through GameLift</b></p> <p>Call these actions from your game clients and/or services to create and manage multiplayer game sessions and player sessions.</p> <ul> <li> <b>Game sessions</b> <ul> <li><a>CreateGameSession</a></li> <li><a>DescribeGameSessions</a></li> <li><a>DescribeGameSessionDetails</a></li> <li><a>UpdateGameSession</a></li> <li><a>SearchGameSessions</a></li> </ul> </li> <li> <b>Player sessions</b> <ul> <li><a>CreatePlayerSession</a></li> <li><a>CreatePlayerSessions</a></li> <li><a>DescribePlayerSessions</a></li> </ul> </li> <li> <b>Other actions:</b> <ul> <li><a>GetGameSessionLogUrl</a></li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p><b>Set Up and Manage Game Servers</b></p> <p>Use these administrative actions to configure GameLift to host your game servers.
