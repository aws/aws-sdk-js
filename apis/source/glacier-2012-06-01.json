With Amazon Glacier, customers can store\n\t\ttheir data cost effectively for months, years, or decades. Amazon Glacier also enables\n\t\tcustomers to offload the administrative burdens of operating and scaling storage to AWS, so\n\t\tthey don't have to worry about capacity planning, hardware provisioning, data replication,\n\t\thardware failure and recovery, or time-consuming hardware migrations.</p>\n\n     <p>Amazon Glacier is a great storage choice when low storage cost is paramount, your data is\n\t\trarely retrieved, and retrieval latency of several hours is acceptable. If your application\n\t\trequires fast or frequent access to your data, consider using Amazon S3. For more\n\t\tinformation, go to <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/s3/\">Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)</a>.</p>\n\n      <p>You can store any kind of data in any format.

After your first successful complete\n\t\t\tmultipart upload, if you call the operation again within a short period, the operation\n\t\t\twill succeed and return the same archive ID. This is useful in the event you experience\n\t\t\ta network issue that causes an aborted connection or receive a 500 server error, in\n\t\t\twhich case you can repeat your Complete Multipart Upload request and get the same\n\t\t\tarchive ID without creating duplicate archives. Note, however, that after the multipart\n\t\t\tupload completes, you cannot call the List Parts operation and the multipart upload will\n\t\t\tnot appear in List Multipart Uploads response, even if idempotent complete is\n\t\t\tpossible.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions).

When you initiate a retrieval job,\n\t\t\tAmazon Glacier creates a job and returns a job ID in the response. When Amazon Glacier completes\n\t\t\tthe job, you can get the job output (archive or inventory data). For information about\n\t\t\tgetting job output, see <a>GetJobOutput</a> operation. </p>\n\n\t\t<p>The job must complete before you can get its output. To determine when a job is complete,\n\t\t\tyou have the following options:</p>\n\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li>\n<p><b>Use Amazon SNS Notification</b> You can specify an\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAmazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic to which Amazon Glacier can\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpost a notification after the job is completed. You can specify an SNS topic\n\t\t\t\t\t\tper job request. The notification is sent only after Amazon Glacier completes the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tjob. In addition to specifying an SNS topic per job request, you can\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconfigure vault notifications for a vault so that job notifications are\n\t\t\t\t\t\talways sent. For more information, see <a>SetVaultNotifications</a>.</p>\n\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t<li>\n<p><b>Get job details</b> You can make a <a>DescribeJob</a> request\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto obtain job status information while a job is in progress. However, it is\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmore efficient to use an Amazon SNS notification to determine when a job is\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcomplete.</p>\n\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\n\t\t<note><p>The information you get via notification is same that you get by calling <a>DescribeJob</a>.</p></note>\n\n\t\t<p>If for a specific event, you add both the notification configuration on the vault and also\n\t\t\tspecify an SNS topic in your initiate job request, Amazon Glacier sends both\n\t\t\tnotifications.  For more information, see <a>SetVaultNotifications</a>.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions). However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don't have any permissions by default. You must grant them explicit permission to perform specific actions. For more information, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/using-iam-with-amazon-glacier.html\">Access Control Using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)</a>.</p>\n\n\t\t<p><b>About the Vault Inventory</b></p>\n\n\t\t<p>Amazon Glacier prepares an inventory for each vault periodically, every 24 hours. When you\n\t\t\t\tinitiate a job for a vault inventory, Amazon Glacier returns the last inventory for\n\t\t\t\tthe vault. The inventory data you get might be up to a day or two days old. Also,\n\t\t\t\tthe initiate inventory job might take some time to complete before you can download\n\t\t\t\tthe vault inventory. So you do not want to retrieve a vault inventory for each vault\n\t\t\t\toperation. However, in some scenarios, you might find the vault inventory useful.\n\t\t\t\tFor example, when you upload an archive, you can provide an archive description but\n\t\t\t\tnot an archive name. Amazon Glacier provides you a unique archive ID, an opaque\n\t\t\t\tstring of characters. So, you might maintain your own database that maps archive\n\t\t\t\tnames to their corresponding Amazon Glacier assigned archive IDs. You might find the\n\t\t\t\tvault inventory useful in the event you need to reconcile information in your\n\t\t\t\tdatabase with the actual vault inventory. </p>\n      \n      <p><b>Range Inventory Retrieval</b></p>\n      <p>You can limit the number of inventory items retrieved by filtering on the archive creation date \n            or by setting a limit.</p>\n      <p><i>Filtering by Archive Creation Date</i></p>\n      <p>You can retrieve inventory items for archives created between <code>StartDate</code> and\n               <code>EndDate</code> by specifying values for these parameters in the \n               <b>InitiateJob</b> request. \n               Archives created on or after the <code>StartDate</code> and before the <code>EndDate</code> will be returned. If\n               you only provide the <code>StartDate</code> without the <code>EndDate</code>, you will retrieve the inventory for\n               all archives created on or after the <code>StartDate</code>. If you only provide the <code>EndDate</code>\n               without the <code>StartDate</code>, you will get back the inventory for all archives created\n               before the <code>EndDate</code>.</p>\t\t\n      \n      <p><i>Limiting Inventory Items per Retrieval</i></p>\n      <p>You can limit the number of inventory items returned by setting the <code>Limit</code>\n         parameter in the <b>InitiateJob</b> request. The\n         inventory job output will contain inventory items up to the specified\n         <code>Limit</code>. If there are more inventory items available, the result\n         is paginated. After a job is complete you can use the <a>DescribeJob</a> \n         operation to get a marker that you use in a subsequent <b>InitiateJob</b> request. \n         The marker will indicate the starting point to retrieve the next set of inventory items. You can page through your\n         entire inventory by repeatedly making <b>InitiateJob</b> requests with the marker from the previous \n         <b>DescribeJob</b> output, until you get a marker from <b>DescribeJob</b> that returns null, indicating\n         that there are no more inventory items available.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\n       <p>You can use the <code>Limit</code> parameter together with the date range parameters.</p>\t  \n      \n      <p><b>About Ranged Archive Retrieval</b></p>\n      <p>\n         You can initiate an archive retrieval for the whole archive or a range of the archive. \n         In the case of ranged archive retrieval, you specify a byte range to return or the whole archive. \n         The range specified must be megabyte (MB) aligned, that is the range start value must be \n         divisible by 1 MB and range end value plus 1 must be divisible by 1 MB or equal the end of the \n         archive. If the ranged archive retrieval is not megabyte aligned, this operation returns a \n         400 response. Furthermore, to ensure you get checksum values for data you download using \n         Get Job Output API, the range must be tree hash aligned.          \n      </p>\n\n\t\t<p>An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions).

You can also limit the number of jobs\n\t\t\treturned in the response by specifying the <code>limit</code> parameter in the\n\t\t\trequest.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>Additionally, you can filter the jobs list returned by specifying an optional\n\t\t\t\t<code>statuscode</code> (InProgress, Succeeded, or Failed) and\n\t\t\t\t<code>completed</code> (true, false) parameter. The <code>statuscode</code> allows\n\t\t\tyou to specify that only jobs that match a specified status are returned.
